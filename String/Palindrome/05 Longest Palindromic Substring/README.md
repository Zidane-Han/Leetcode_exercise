# Longest Palindromic Substring (Medium)

## Description

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

**Example 1:**

```c++
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```

**Example 2:**

```c++
Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

## Idea

**Approach 1:** by definition

**Approach 2:** dynamic programming

**Approach 3:** Manacher's Algorithm
