# Power of Four (Easy)

## Description

Given an integer (signed 32 bits), write a function to check whether it is a power of 4.

**Example 1:**

```html
Input: 16
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```html
Input: 5
Output: false
```

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without loops/recursion?

## Idea

Solution 1: naive method

Solution 2: bit manipulation. Binary format of the integer: only one "1" at odd position, the others are "0".
