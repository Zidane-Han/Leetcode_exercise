## Basic bit manipulation
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/bitwise_operators_example.htm
- **&** (AND: operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands)
- **|** (OR: it copies a bit if it exists in either operand)
- **^** (Ones Complement: it is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits)
- **<<** (Left Shift: the left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand)
- **>>** (Right Shift: the right operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand)
