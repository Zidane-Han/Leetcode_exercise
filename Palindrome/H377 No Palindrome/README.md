# No Palindrome (Hard)
## Description
A string is acceptable only if all of its letters are at the front p of the alphabet and the string contains no palindrome longer than 1.

Please find the next acceptable string that keeps the same length of the given one; otherwise, return "NO".

For example, given cba and p=4. The next strings with the same length are cbb and cbc, but they are not acceptable. Therefore the next acceptable will be cbd.
